This project provides a so-called [InstantiationPrinter](src/InstantiationPrinter.php). I'm not the only one who has attempted to build such a thing: <https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser/issues/566>

Example: `$instance = new self();`
In PHP-Parser nodes this will be:

```
array(
    0: Stmt_Expression(
        expr: Expr_Assign(
            var: Expr_Variable(
                name: instance
            )
            expr: Expr_New(
                class: Name(
                    parts: array(
                        0: self
                    )
                )
                args: array(
                )
            )
        )
    )
)
```

When printed by the `InstantiationPrinter` this becomes:

```php
new PhpParser\Node\Stmt\Expression(
    new PhpParser\Node\Expr\Assign(
        new PhpParser\Node\Expr\Variable('instance'),
        new PhpParser\Node\Expr\New_(
            new PhpParser\Node\Name('self')
        )
    )
);
```

## Usage

Install this library in your project:

```bash
composer require --dev matthiasnoback/php-parser-instantiation-printer
```

You'll have command-line tool now, that generates the nodes based on the provided PHP script:

```bash
bin/print-node-instantiation-code temp.php
```

(if you don't have a `bin/` directory in your project, try `vendor/bin`)

You can also instantiate your own `InstantiationPrinter` service.
Take a look at the code in the `print-node-instantiation-code` script to find out how to accomplish this.
